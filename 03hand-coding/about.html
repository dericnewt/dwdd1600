<p>What started as a simple Excel spreadsheet has now grown to be an expansive collection of sports data and highlights supported by the best community in the world!</p>
<p>We began with simple roots when a student at the University of Utah came across several databases of statistics and info on various college football programs, but was unable 
    to find any real flexibility or user-friendly features that made analyzing the data simple and clear. Taking matters into their own hands, they spent months data-scraping and 
    collecting everything they could find and compiling it into a customizable spreadsheet that displayed the data in a unique way.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet would eventually spring to life the <strong>C.F.B.B.S.A.M.</strong> (<em>College Football Blue Bloods Statistical Analyzer Matrix</em>), or <strong>S.A.M.</strong> for short, which eventually gave way to an Instagram community, which 
    grew into the nation-wide outlet that we are today!</p>
